This repository contains OpenFOAM cases simulating different fluid dynamics problems:

1. Flow Around a Cylinder
Simulation of incompressible viscous flow around a circular cylinder using OpenFOAM. This classic benchmark involves resolving vortex shedding, boundary layers, and wake formation in 2D or 3D domains. Typical solvers like icoFoam or simpleFoam are used depending on flow regime. The domain is meshed to capture finer details near the cylinder surface and in the wake region, supporting studies of drag, lift, and flow patterns.

2. Sloshing in a Baffle Tank
Simulation of fluid sloshing dynamics inside a tank with internal baffles using OpenFOAM's multiphase and free surface capabilities. This setup models transient fluid motion and interaction with tank walls and baffles, useful for analyzing stability and dynamic pressure loads in containment systems.
